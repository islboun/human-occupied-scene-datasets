# human-occupied-scene-datasets

Two human-occupied scene datasets are presented in the work "Reliable and Fast Humans Removed Visual Scene Representation":

## ISL-BU-S: 

Provides scene images from five places with distinct backgrounds. The images contain 1-4 people with varying obstruction complexity levels. The reference image with only a static background is given at each scene. Percent occlusion, number of human segments, and the measured obstruction complexity are also given in .json files.

## ISL-BU-D: 

Provides consecutive images from a robot moving in two distinct routes indoors. At each route, the robot observes one of the following:
      ** Following a human target along the route. 
      ** Following another human target along the route.
      ** No human targets, only static images are observed.
